## Executive Summary
The U.S. Tech Services firm expects to receive 12,500,000 euros in one year. The current EUR/USD spot rate is 1.1613. However, exchange rate volatility could affect how much the firm receives in U.S. dollars. This project evaluates three hedging strategies: a forward market hedge, a money market hedge, and an options hedge. Forward hedging allows the firm to be risk averse with fixed exchange rates, but eliminates the opportunity for favorable exchange rate changes. The money market hedge is more complex, but allows the firm to borrow in foreign currency to hedge its foreign currency receivables to match its assets and liabilities. The options hedge protects the firm if the euro depreciates, but still allows gains. However, option hedging has premium costs. The expected outcome is to determine which hedging strategy is the most effective in protecting future proceeds.

## Background & Objectives
The firm’s clients pay invoices in euros, which exposes future USD receivables to foreign exchange risk. The primary objective is to identify and recommend the optimal hedging strategy to stabilize USD cash inflows. The secondary goals include comparing hedge effectiveness and cost under different exchange rates, developing an Excel-based model for future decisions, and present findings for decision making.

## Methods
I will construct an Excel-spreadsheet model incorporating market data including spot rates, forward rates, interest rates, and option premiums. 

Analysis steps:
Simulate ±5 % and ±10 % EUR/USD movements.
Determine USD receivables for unhedged, forward, money-market, and option outcomes.
Compare hedge costs, expected values, and standard deviations.
Evaluate each hedge by risk reduction and cost-benefit analysis.
Assess results with summary tables and charts for management.

Tools: Microsoft Excel, Finance principles and concepts

## Limitations & Next Steps
Limitations include interest-rate assumptions, static option premiums, and estimated volatility because they may not accurately reflect shifts in the future market.

Next steps: 
Develop a quantitative plan for a spreadsheet model.
Implement your spec into a basic .xlsx model.
Write an AI prompt that generates the spreadsheet that matches my spec.
Use my model to select a hedge.
